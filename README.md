# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
Using import math function,do the calculations.
## Step 2:
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
## Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
## Step 4:
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
## Step 5:
End the program.
